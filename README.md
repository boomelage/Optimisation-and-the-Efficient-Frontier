The archiving of PyPortfolioOpt was needed due to an error in the plotting style found in plotting.py of the library.
Kindly find the Pypfopt library it in the repository as a zip file. This is required for the code to run.

This repository is for educational purposes only. I do not own any rights to the PyPortfolioOpt library, kindly
contact me at radusbriciu@proton.me for the removal of the archived scripts.
