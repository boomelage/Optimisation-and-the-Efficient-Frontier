The workings for an Asset Pricing exercise from MSc Quantitative Finance 2023/24 at Bayes Business School

The archiving of PyPortfolioOpt was needed due to an error in the plotting style found in plotting.py of the library.
Kindly find the Pypfopt library in the repository. The code automatically uses the Pypfopt present here.

This repository is for educational purposes only. I do not own any rights to the PyPortfolioOpt library, kindly
contact me at radusbriciu@proton.me for the removal of the archived scripts.
